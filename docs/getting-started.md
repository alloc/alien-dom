# Getting Started

```
npm install alien-dom
pnpm install alien-dom
yarn add alien-dom
```

## 1. Add the esbuild plugin

```
npm install @alien-dom/esbuild
```

## 2. Create your first component

```tsx
function Hello() {
  return <div>Hello world</div>
}

document.body.append(<Hello />)
```

## 3. Learn the different Hooks

Hooks can only be used in components or in custom Hooks. Donâ€™t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your component, before any early returns.

### useState

Runs a given callback once and returns the result. Any extra arguments to `useState` are forwarded to the callback.

### useEffect

Runs a given callback whenever the dependency array has a different set of values in a subsequent render. The callback can return a destructor, which is called to clean up any side-effects.

### useMemo

Runs a given callback whenever the dependency array has a different set of values in a subsequent render. The callback's return value is memoized and returned.

### useRef

Creates a `Ref` object that can be observed when its `value` property changes. You may pass an initial value, but a function argument will be called and its result will be used as the initial value instead.

There are many more hooks, but they are not as commonly used. I will be documenting them soon.
